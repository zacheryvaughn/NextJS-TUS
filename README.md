- **UI Components**: Modern interface built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS

### Backend Infrastructure
- **[`route.ts`](app/api/upload/[[...params]]/route.ts)**: TUS protocol implementation (POST, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS)
- **[`tus-multipart-manager.ts`](lib/upload/services/tus-multipart-manager.ts)**: Parallel upload coordination and file assembly
- **[`tus-file-operations.ts`](lib/upload/services/tus-file-operations.ts)**: File system operations and metadata management

### Intelligent Upload System
- **Stream Optimization**: Dynamic allocation of concurrent upload streams based on file size
- **Batch Processing**: Knapsack algorithm for optimal file batching within stream limits
- **Progress Aggregation**: Accurate progress calculation across multiple parallel parts
- **Assembly Pipeline**: Seamless reconstruction of multipart uploads

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### TUS Protocol Compliance
Full implementation of the TUS resumable upload protocol with:
- **Creation Extension**: File upload initialization with metadata
- **Core Protocol**: Resumable upload with offset tracking
- **Termination Extension**: Upload cancellation and cleanup

### Multipart Upload Strategy
```typescript
// Intelligent part calculation based on file size
const getPartCount = (fileSize: number): number => {
  if (fileSize <= 50 * 1024 * 1024) return 1;        // ≤50MB: single part
  if (fileSize <= 500 * 1024 * 1024) return 4;       // ≤500MB: 4 parts
  if (fileSize <= 2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) return 8;  // ≤2GB: 8 parts
  return 16;                                          // >2GB: 16 parts
};
```

### Stream Management Algorithm
- **Knapsack Optimization**: Maximizes concurrent streams while respecting limits
- **Dynamic Batching**: Continuously processes new files during active uploads
- **Resource Allocation**: Intelligent distribution of upload bandwidth

### Filename Strategy System
Extensible filename handling with multiple strategies:
- **Default**: Uses unique upload IDs
- **Original**: Preserves original filenames with sanitization
- **Custom**: Pluggable system for custom naming conventions
